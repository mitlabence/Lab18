"The absorption spectrum measured in this manner will largely look like a Doppler broadened spectrum, though with sharp peaks in the middle of Doppler broadened peaks as seen in Figure 1." 
Figure 1 shows the transmission spectrum; corrected to

"Thus a peak in the Doppler broadened absorption spectrum is observed, called a Lamb dip." 
Corrected in similar fashion to 
"Thus a dip in the Doppler broadened absorption spectrum is observed, called a Lamb dip. In the corresponding transmission spectrum, it is a peak as mentioned earlier, sometimes referred to as Lamb peak. We consider the latter spectrum in the following, as it was what we observed."

Figure 2: the I refers to current (probably), changed the caption slightly, from
"An example of a dispersive signal used as the error signal for locking the cooling laser."
to
"An example of a dispersive signal showing the shape of the error signal used for locking the cooling laser."
